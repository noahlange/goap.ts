Created by Jeff Orkin of Monolith Productions, GOAP is employed by a variety of AAA game titles, known for its high level of flexibility and ease-of-use. Those interested in learning more should check out [Jeff's website.](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html)\r\n\r\nBy taking the current state of the AI (e.g.: Hungry? Tired?) and their desired state (e.g.: Not tired) a \"plan\" is generated to take the AI from their current state to their goal state by considering a list of actions. By attaching weights to these actions, GOAP is capable of producing highly dynamic results. In this case, the AI will discover that in order to sleep, they must first find and consume food, potentially leading to a complex course of action that involves going shopping, cooking, ordering pizza, taking a shower, etc.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2016 Noah Lange\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
